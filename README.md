FutiSta demo and training to learn node.js, Express, sockets.io etc.
Originally created a proof of concept football match tool with you can collect game statistics online. This was done with PHP, MySQL, jQuery, AJAX, JS etc.
Basically you could have several observers to fill in data based on your profile. This would make it possible to get more data and more exact data.

Now after 4 years idea is to port this to more recent technologies which will support better responsive model this webapp requires.
Please note that all development will be done after normal work hours so it might take quite a long time...


**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).
